# FryderykGPT

## 🎹 A Discord Bot That Channels Fryderyk Chopin (and Used to Play Music)

FryderykGPT is a characterful Discord bot that impersonates the composer Fryderyk Chopin, powered by the OpenAI Assistant API. It once delighted users by responding in elegant prose **and** playing music directly in voice channels—until recent limitations made the latter no longer feasible.

## 👋 Final Words from Fryderyk

> *“Alas, though I can no longer perform for you in sound, my spirit remains to converse, reflect, and reminisce. Let us speak, if not sing.”*
